Dear colleague,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;The VASP group seeks one scientist for the development of the software&nbsp;package VASP (Vienna ab-initio Simulation Package). VASP is a de facto&nbsp;standard for the simulation of condensed matter systems using the&nbsp;Schroedinger equation. A very exciting and lively working environment with&nbsp;many collaborative research projects involving theory as well as&nbsp;experimental groups is offered. The work will cover VASP software&nbsp;maintenance and support, optimization of the existing codes for latest&nbsp;high&nbsp;performance computer architectures (e.g. Intel &Acirc; Xeon, Nvidia GPU), cutting&nbsp;edge theory developments as enumerated below, as well as co-development of&nbsp;workflow tools (ASE, AiiDA, pymatgen, etc.).<br />
&nbsp;We seek candidates holding a PhD in physics or chemistry and an excellent&nbsp;record in any area of computational solid state physics or chemistry. The&nbsp;areas of expertise can include - but are not restricted to - density&nbsp;functional theory, many-body Green&acirc;&euro;&trade;s function techniques, quantum field&nbsp;theoretical methods, quantum chemistry methods, or modelling of condensed&nbsp;matter systems. Candidates with proven expertise in developing new&nbsp;computational methods and adapting them to high performance computers will&nbsp;be given preference. Prior knowledge of VASP is advantageously but not&nbsp;strictly required.
<p>&nbsp;All applications shall include<br />
&nbsp;i) CV including full academic record,<br />
&nbsp;ii) list of publications and talks including two reprints representative of previous research,<br />
&nbsp;iii) expression of interest concerning research area(s) and previous&nbsp;expertise (one page).<br />
&nbsp;Applications need to be sent to georg.kresse_at_univie.ac.at<br />
&nbsp;(topic: Scientific software developer).<br />
&nbsp;Selection of candidates will start immediately and continue until the&nbsp;positions are filled. The contract will be for one year initially, with the&nbsp;possibility for a permanent contract after positive evaluation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Sincerely,<br />
&nbsp;The VASP team</p>
